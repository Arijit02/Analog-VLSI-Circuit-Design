Here I designed a Low Dropout Voltage (LDO) Regulator which gives a constant voltage of 2V for input voltage range of 2.2V-3.6V. 
For this purpose I designed a 2-stage Miller Compensated OTA which I used as the error detector block. I used a BGR block to 
generate a reference voltage of 1.2V. This LDO also works very efficiently for pretty large loads due to cascaded PMOS pass element.
